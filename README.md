This folder contains my technical assessment for an internship at Prep Baseball Report for the summer of 2023. 

A reader-friendly version of my code is hosted in the PBR_Exercise.ipynb file. 

To run my code, go to the PBR_Exercise.ipynb, and click the 'raw' button above the code. This generates the raw text behind the code. Next, save that code to your local machine with the .txt extension. You can then open jupyter notebook on your local machine and drag the .txt file you saved. Finally, rename the file in jupyter notebook, removing the .txt extension and replacing it with the .ipynb extension. With that, you should be able to run and change my code locally.
